# MemoryMaster

A scientific approach to memory assessment and tracking.

## Games Overview

MemoryMaster provides three precision memory challenge games designed to establish and track your memory baseline:

### 1. Number Memory Game

Assess your numerical memory recall capabilities.

#### Objective
Systematically measure your ability to remember and reproduce numerical sequences.

#### How to Play
1. A sequence of numbers will be displayed.
2. Memorize the sequence within a limited time.
3. Input the sequence you remember.
4. Consistently track your performance across repeated attempts.
5. Establish a reliable memory baseline for numerical information.

### 2. Box Memorization Game

Evaluate your visual and spatial memory performance.

#### Objective
Precisely measure your ability to recall spatial patterns and box positions.

#### How to Play
1. A grid of boxes will briefly highlight a specific pattern.
2. After the pattern disappears, reproduce the exact sequence of highlighted boxes.
3. Systematically record your ability to recall spatial information.
4. Generate consistent metrics for visual memory performance.

### 3. Anagrams Game

Measure cognitive flexibility and word recall.

#### Objective
Assess your ability to manipulate and recall linguistic information.

#### How to Play
1. Receive a scrambled set of letters.
2. Rearrange the letters to create meaningful words.
3. Track your performance in word generation and recall.
4. Generate metrics for linguistic memory and processing.

## Purpose

- Establish a scientific baseline of memory performance
- Provide consistent, repeatable memory assessment
- Track memory capabilities over time
- Generate data-driven insights into personal cognitive performance
